		@   Programming Assignment 6, Problem 1
		@   11/14
		@	This program will use a function that computes a^b
		@   where a and b are integer values. We will use the pow function,
		@   and other instructions, to compute a^b â€“ 3*a.
		@---------------------
		@ In those you will use the provided function pow to comput
		@ a^b - 3a
		@ You must set up the arguments to pow and call it using BL
		@ The result should be in R4 after the program completes

    LDR R1, [R1]    @ LOADS CONTENTS OF R1(B) INTO R1
    MOV R5, #3      @ MOVES 3 INTO R5

    BL pow          @ BRANCH FUNCTION POW (A^B)

    LDR R7, =a      @ LOADS A (4) INTO R7
    LDR R7, [R7]    @ LOADS CONTENTS OF R7 (A) INTO R7

    MUL R3, R7, R5  @ MULTIPLIES R5(3) x R7 (A) (3^a)
